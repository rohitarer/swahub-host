      <h2>Data Retention &amp; Security</h2>
      <p>
        Swahub stores data in MongoDB Atlas and Supabase Storage within the
        same geographic region as the majority of our users. We apply industry
        standard security practices (encryption in transit, role-based access,
        audit logging) and only retain personal information while your account
        remains active or as required for legal obligations.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Swahub is intended for professionals 16 years of age or older. If we
        learn that a minor has created an account, we will remove it.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy as our Services evolve. Material updates are
        announced in-app. Continued use of Swahub after changes take effect
        constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
