      <p>
        Swahub respects your right to control your information. This policy
        describes how to request deletion of account data and what information
        is removed when a request is fulfilled.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Self-Service Account Deletion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Open the Swahub app and navigate to <em>Settings &gt; Delete
          account</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Confirm the company keyword and follow the prompts. Deletion requires
          re-authentication through Firebase.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once confirmed, the account is scheduled for deletion and most data is
          purged within 24 hours.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Manual Deletion Requests</h2>
      <p>
        If you cannot access the app, submit a request through
        <em>Settings &gt; Connect Swahub Team</em> (include the email/UID
        associated with your profile). Our support team will verify ownership
        and handle the request manually.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>What Gets Deleted</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Profile data, authentication identifiers, company information, posts,
          flares, reactions, and attachments stored in Supabase.
        </li>
        <li>
          Private conversations in chat rooms where you are the sole participant.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some content may remain if it belongs to other collaborators (for
        example, group chats, shared opportunity records) but it will no longer
        be linked to your identity.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Retention Exceptions</h2>
      <p>
        Swahub may retain limited records if required to comply with applicable
        laws, enforce agreements, resolve disputes, or detect abuse. Backup
        snapshots are removed on a rolling basis (max 30 days).
      </p>
