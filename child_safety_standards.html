  <h1>Swahub – Child Safety Standards</h1>

  <p>Swahub is a professional social platform for startup–focused individuals. We are committed to
     protecting children online and have zero tolerance for child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE)
     or child sexual abuse material (CSAM).</p>

  <h2>1. Eligibility and use</h2>
  <p>Swahub is intended for users aged 16+ (or the higher age required in their country). Accounts
     that are suspected to belong to minors below the minimum age may be restricted or removed.</p>

  <h2>2. Zero tolerance for CSAM</h2>
  <p>The following content is strictly prohibited and leads to immediate removal and account
     termination: any sexualized content involving minors, grooming, sexual solicitation of minors,
     or links that point to such material.</p>

  <h2>3. Reporting child safety concerns</h2>
  <p>Users can report content or accounts directly inside the app and may also email
     <a href="mailto:rohitarer00@gmail.com">rohitarer00@gmail.com</a> with details and screenshots
     or links. We prioritize and review these reports as quickly as possible.</p>

  <h2>4. Enforcement and cooperation with authorities</h2>
  <p>When we believe content may constitute CSAM or exploitation of a child, we remove it, ban the
     account, and may preserve relevant data and report the matter to appropriate law enforcement or
     cybercrime authorities in the applicable jurisdiction.</p>

  <h2>5. Continuous improvement</h2>
  <p>We may update these standards as laws or best practices evolve. The latest version will always
     be available on this page.</p>
